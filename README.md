DESCRIPTION OF TASK 4:
As part of my internship at CODTECH, I successfully completed Task-4, which involved the implementation of a Machine Learning model using Scikit-learn to perform a classification task. I carried out this task using the Jupyter Notebook platform, a widely used web-based interactive computing environment that is perfect for running and presenting data science and machine learning projects. I began the task by installing essential Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib using the command line and pip installer. For the dataset, I chose the Iris dataset, which is a popular built-in dataset available in Scikit-learn. This dataset consists of measurements of different species of Iris flowers and is commonly used for multi-class classification problems. I loaded the dataset using Scikit-learn’s built-in load_iris() function and then converted it into a pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation. The next step involved preprocessing the data, splitting it into training and testing sets using train_test_split from Scikit-learn, and selecting a suitable classification model. I used the RandomForestClassifier due to its high accuracy and robustness. After training the model on the training data, I used it to predict outcomes on the test data. The performance of the model was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy score and classification report, which includes precision, recall, and F1-score. The model achieved excellent results with an accuracy of 100%, indicating it classified all test instances correctly. Throughout the implementation, I documented each step in the Jupyter Notebook with comments and markdown cells for better understanding and readability. The tools I used in this project include Python programming language, Scikit-learn for machine learning implementation, Pandas for data handling, and Jupyter Notebook for development and presentation. This task helped me understand the complete workflow of a machine learning project, from data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation. Such machine learning models are widely applicable in real-world domains such as spam email detection, disease diagnosis, customer churn prediction, credit risk scoring, and many more. This project not only enhanced my technical skills but also improved my ability to present and explain the working of an ML model in a structured format. Overall, this task was a valuable hands-on experience that deepened my understanding of supervised learning techniques and their applications. I gained confidence in using Scikit-learn’s tools and understood the importance of model evaluation metrics. The project output was successfully displayed in the form of accuracy and a detailed classification report, which served as a measure of the model's effectiveness. Finally, I exported the completed notebook as a .ipynb file and prepared it for submission as instructed in the internship deliverables. Completing this task gave me practical exposure to one of the most important areas in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, preparing me for more complex projects in the future.
